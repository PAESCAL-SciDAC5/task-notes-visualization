* When: 2022-09-12, 11:30am PT, 2:30pm ET
* Who: Berk Geveci, Chris Harris, Hui Wan
* Topic: Using ParaView on EAM output

## Notes

* Chris downloaded the sample data from [Hui's directory](https://compy-dtn.pnl.gov/wanh895/ParaView_EAM/cubed_sphere/model_output_samples/) and had a look at the CLOUD field.
* Berk suggested that before the next meeting, we should all get ParaView and take a look at the sample data. In the next meeting, Hui should walk the others through the sample data.
* Hui planned to provide a new sample data file with more typical fields for us to look at together.
  * Update by Hui from 9/13/2022: I uploaded a new sample output file `PD_1800_ad4fd8_ANN_climo_SE.nc` to [the directory](https://compy-dtn.pnl.gov/wanh895/ParaView_EAM/cubed_sphere/model_output_samples/). This file has more typical meteorological fields (like winds, temperature, clouds, aerosol-related quantities). Also, the values are annual averages, which can help us orient ourseleves.

## Next meeting: 2022-09-19
